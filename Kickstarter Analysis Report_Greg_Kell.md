# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louise is looking to launch a crowdfunding campaign to raise money to help produce one of her plays. This is her first time using Kickstarter and she is not quite sure where to start or how to structure her campaign. She knows there have been many successful campaigns in the past (and some not so successful ones!) and she would like to learn from those in order to ensure that her fundraising goal is met. 

### Purpose
We were hired by Louise to try and determine the characteristics of succesful kickstarter campaigns to provide some insight into how she should structure her own crowdfunding effort. 


## Analysis and Challenges
To provide Louise with the insights she desires, we pulled a dataset from Kickstarter of roughly 4,000 campaigns that were launched between 2009 and 2017. This data provided us with details including the campaign's goal, pledged amount, date launched, duration, category and total number of backers. With this data we can make some inferences on what makes a successful crowdfunding campaign.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Having combed through the data to make some initial assumptions, we pinpointed launch date as a variable worth considering when planning a crowdfunding campaign. While there may be some externalities that can impact this (e.g., a Kickstarter to fund a new snow shovel probably won't do too well in April) we determined that the dataset was large and diverse enough to prove useful.   

Across all categories, campaigns launched in May were the most successful. 




### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
